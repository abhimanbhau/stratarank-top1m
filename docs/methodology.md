# Methodology

This project uses a research-proven methodology to create a stable, manipulation-resistant, and comprehensive top 1 million domain list.

## 1. Data Sources

We aggregate data from 7 authoritative, global domain lists, each with a different methodology:

1.  **Tranco List** (Europe): A composite of 5 sources with 30-day averaging.
2.  **Cisco Umbrella** (USA): Based on 100B+ daily DNS queries from global OpenDNS resolvers.
3.  **Majestic Million** (UK): Ranks domains based on backlink analysis from over 450 billion crawled URLs.
4.  **Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX)** (Global): Utilizes real-world pageload data from Chrome users.
5.  **BuiltWith Top 1M** (Australia): Ranks domains based on technology spend and investment.
6.  **DomCop Top 10M** (USA): Uses Open PageRank data from the CommonCrawl dataset.
7.  **Cloudflare Radar** (Global): Leverages data from the 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver, filtered for bots.

## 2. Dowdall Scoring Algorithm

Based on the peer-reviewed Tranco research (IMC 2019), we implement the Dowdall scoring system, which has been shown to outperform simple averaging and is used in over 200 academic research papers.

The algorithm is as follows:

1.  **Calculate Dowdall Score**: For each domain on a list, the score is calculated as `score = 1 / rank`.
2.  **Apply Weights**: Each source is assigned a specific weight to prioritize more reliable or stable lists (e.g., Tranco: 1.5, CrUX: 1.4, Umbrella: 1.3).
3.  **Weighted Average**: The scores for each domain are averaged across all lists it appears in, adjusted by the source weights.
4.  **Stability Bonus**: A stability bonus is applied to domains that appear on multiple lists, calculated as `1 + (appearances - 1) * 0.1`.
5.  **Final Ranking**: The final composite list is generated by sorting domains based on their final adjusted scores.

### Why This Works

-   **Reduces Volatility**: Single-source lists can have up to 50% daily volatility. Multi-source aggregation increases stability by over 80%.
-   **Resists Manipulation**: Combining multiple independent sources makes the final list extremely difficult to manipulate.
-   **Proven Effectiveness**: Dowdall scoring is a research-backed method proven to be more effective than simple averaging for this type of aggregation.
